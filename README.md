# Our Olympe Scripts
We are writing python scripts on Olympe GroundSDK for a Parrot ANFI drone programming project.

# Olympe Overview
Olympe is an SDK that provides a Python controller programming interface for Parrot ANAFI drones. It can be used to connect to and control a drone from a remote Python script running on a Linux based computer. Olympe is compatible with the following drones from Parrot: ANAFI, ANAFI Thermal, ANAFI USA, and ANAFI AI.
